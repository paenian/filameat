# filameat
Attempting to grind up old plastic with a temperature-controlled meat grinder.

Currently this contains the code for the Arduino stack.

In Stack Order:
LinkSprite LCD shield w/5 buttons
Sparkfun proto board, with a simple thermistor circuit
Extra headers to clear the relay
Single relay board
Diavolino


The other hardware is:
No. 32 meat grinder
36" of AC heater cable
100K thermistor
exhaust pipe wrap
various wires/connectors

It's mounted to a slab of butcher block countertop that I cut out to install the sink.  Makes it look kind of kitchen-y.


I'd like to motorize the beast at some point, too, but for now it's hand-crank only.
